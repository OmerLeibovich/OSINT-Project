from services.scan_strategies import ScannerStrategy


# This module defines the ScanService class, which manages execution of multiple OSINT scanners in parallel.

# The service uses the provided scanner strategy implementations (e.g., AmassScanner, TheHarvesterScanner)
# and runs them concurrently via asyncio. Each tool's result is combined into a unified structure.

# Components:
# dedup_list(): utility function to clean and deduplicate list entries.
# ScanService: main class that coordinates all scanning tools.

# Methods:
# __init__(scanners): receives a dict of tool name â†’ scanner strategy.
# run_all_stream(domain, source): runs all scanners concurrently and yields their results as they arrive.

# Output structure per tool:
# {
#   "source": "amass" | "theHarvester",
#   "result": {...},                # raw result from the tool
#   "combined": {...}               # merged & deduplicated results from all tools up to this point
# }

# Note:
# Uses asyncio.as_completed to yield tool results as they finish (not necessarily in order).
# Handles errors gracefully per scanner and reports them back in the yielded dict.
